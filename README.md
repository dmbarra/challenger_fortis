**Things I should do differently:**<br>
_Setup a lint for the project_<br>
_Put these tests running on a pipeline_<br>
_Commit changes separately_<br>

**How I did:**<br>
_I did step by step, for ex. I got first line and check the app, identify the element and put that on PO_<br>
_For the assertions give me little bit more work, soon I was able to identify the element I extract text and validate_<br>
_For last assertion I used regex to help me since the elements "p" it's common everywhere, but its working fine_<br>
_Soon all code was running well I start to work in refactor, rename variables, put the date on same format, etc._<br>
_On conversion of date I had some problems, but at end was working again_<br>

**Node version:**<br>
_v14.21.3_<br>

**Install dependencies:**<br>
_npm install_<br>

**Run automation:**<br>
_npm run test:local:run_<br>
